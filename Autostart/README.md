# Quick Setup for Live Linux Images

I use live Linux images and don't mess with persistence. Keeps things clean, but that also means reinstalling everything on every boot â€” kinda a hassle, but whatever.

So, I made a bunch of scripts to handle all my stuff with one command. They install my tools, slap on some **cyberpunk** terminal styles, and set up everything I need. No need to spend time configuring anything each time I boot. Just runs and does its thing.

### What's in Here:
- **Cyberpunk vibes** for my setups
- A bunch of tools I use, automatically set up
- Random utility and automation scripts for whatever needs doing
